###By ***{Loise Mwarangu}***
# Description
Everything triangular is a website that helps the user find out types of triangle once the lengths of all three sides are inputted
#### Setup/Installation Requirements
* An internet connection is mandatory
* To access the website,one must have this link https://loisemwarangu.github.io/triangle-tracker/triangle-tracker
* Clicking on the link will show you the documents in the repository.They will be listed in blue below the red horizontal line.Scroll to and click on the desired file and the file will be displayed.
* In one wishes to edit,Above the file content, click edit (or icon that looks like a pen). At this point, GitHub forks the repository for you and this means you can freely edit.Do not however forget to commit your changes(instructions will be at the bottom of the page)
* You can fork then clone the file in case you need to have it on your local repository.This will also allow you to edit it.
* Once inside the website, the user needs to have three values (lengths of the three sides of a triangle).Failure to convert values to similar measuring units could lead to an error .i have included a link to an online converter to avoid such errors
* after this,the user needs to click on the submit button upon which a pop up box appears at the top of the string showing the respective type of triangle the user has
* The user is not allowed to input characters that are not numbers. inputting a negative number, a zero or less than 3 values will lead to a pop up box that shows that no triangle was formed with the given values.
### Technologies Used
I used HTML language , java script and Cascading Style Sheets to create this project.
