# {Everything Triangular}
###By ***{Loise Mwarangu}***
# Description
Everything triangular is a website that helps the user find out types of triangle once the lengths of all three sides are inputted
#### Setup/Installation Requirements
* An internet connection is mandatory
* This website has only been tested using Chrome and Mozilla Firefox
* To access the website,one must have this link https://loisemwarangu.github.io/triangle-tracker/triangle-tracker
* Clicking on the link will show you the documents in the repository.They will be listed in blue below the red horizontal line.Scroll to and click on the desired file and the file will be displayed.
* In one wishes to edit,Above the file content, click edit (or icon that looks like a pen). At this point, GitHub forks the repository for you and this means you can freely edit.Do not however forget to commit your changes(instructions will be at the bottom of the page)
* You can fork then clone the file in case you need to have it on your local repository.This will also allow you to edit it.
* Once inside the website, the user needs to have three values (lengths of the three sides of a triangle).Failure to convert values to similar measuring units could lead to an error .i have included a link to an online converter to avoid such errors
* after this,the user needs to click on the submit button upon which a pop up box appears at the top of the string showing the respective type of triangle the user has
* The user is not allowed to input characters that are not numbers. inputting a negative number, a zero or failing to fill out all the prompts will lead to a pop up box that shows an error
* There are only 5 possible outcomes and they are;
Equilateral: All sides are equal.(an example of an instance where this response would be received is if input was 66,66 and 66 respectively)
Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.(an example of an instance where this response would be received is if input was 66,66 and 50 respectively)
Scalene: No sides are equal.(an example of an instance where this response would be received is if input was 45,66,99 respectively)
NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side. (this can happen if user inputted a value that is not a number or left a field blank  for example 45,77, )
error:please enter values that are greater than zero(for example -1,5,7)
### Technologies Used
I used HTML language , java script and Cascading Style Sheets to create this project.
